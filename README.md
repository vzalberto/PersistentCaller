Persistent Caller
================

Version 1:
	- Has shortcuts for 3 Mexico city radio stations. Will add more.
	- Pretty basic/ugly UIX. Must improve.

Inspired by http://www.mkyong.com/android/how-to-make-a-phone-call-in-android/

Needs:

- Listener for radio app intents
- Persistent notification active when the radio is opened
- Database for radio stations
- A better name :S
